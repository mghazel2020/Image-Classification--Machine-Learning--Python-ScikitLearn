# Image-Classification--Machine-Learning--ScikitLearn

# 1. Objectives

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use scikit-learn to recognize images of hand-written digits, from 0-9.
We shall apply a standard Machine Learning (ML) via Scikit-Learn process, with the following steps:
Load the input data set and split into training and test data subsets

# 2. Data Set

*   The DIGITS dataset of handwritten digits in the Scikit-Learn database
*   A set of 1,797 labeled examples
*   It is a small subset of a larger set available from MNIST, which contains 70,000 images. 
*   The DIGITS have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size grayscale image (8x8x1 pixels)
*   This is different from the full MNIST data set, where the grayscale images are 28x28x1 pixels.
    
# 4. Approach

1. Load the input data set and split into training and test data subsets 

2.  Select and build a ML classification algorithm from scikit-learn API:

  * We shall explore the performance of the following ML algorithms:

    * LogisticRegression
    * DecisionTree and Random Forest
    * Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Train the selected ML model

3. Deploy the trained on the test data

4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics:

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Other metrics derived form the confusion matrix

5. Perform hyperparameter search and fine-tuning to identify more optimal ML model paramaters:

* Explore grid-search and random-search to identify the parameter
* Train the selected model using the identified hyperparameters
* Deploy the improved trained on the test data
* Evaluate the performance of the improved model
